## About IOV Foundation

IOV Foundation is an organization dedicated to improving economic opportunities through blockchain and digital technology. Founded in 2017 in Zug, Switzerland, it focuses on empowering financially excluded individuals by providing access to productive financial instruments through digital identities and reputational models. Its mission is to build a secure and inclusive financial ecosystem using advanced technologies to create transparency and trust, promoting a more connected, equitable, and sustainable world.

### What tools do we use?
We utilize cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and cryptography to create a secure, transparent, and reliable environment.

### Ecosystem

We are part of a diverse community of individuals, companies, and organizations that share a common vision of transforming business models and empowering people through innovative and collaborative technologies.

## Strategic Principles

### Transparency and Traceability
Trust is essential in relationships among organizations, governments, businesses, and citizens. Transparency in fund usage and the ability to verifiably demonstrate the impact of our actions are fundamental pillars.

### Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
We promote the autonomy and data care of individuals by giving them greater control over their data, enhancing their privacy, security, and access to critical services such as health, education, and financial support in environments both near and far from major cities. We create tools that allow people to validate their identity and reputation reliably, securely, and remotely.

### Financial Empowerment
Blockchain facilitates financial inclusion by providing transparent, secure, and accessible financial services, reducing fraud and costs, and promoting financial independence.
